**_Bastard son of Python and Haskell, and failed Scratch_**

## About
Squanchy is a brand new, easy to learn, general purpose, multi-paradigm, high performance programming language created by:

* **Marcos V. Conde**  [Jesucrist0](https://github.com/Jesucrist0)
* **Gabriel Rodr√≠guez Canal**  [gabrielrodcanal](https://github.com/gabrielrodcanal)

Work on the language began on September, 2018.
The language is written from scratch (it includes an integrated lexer, parser and interpreter, etc.).

## Example
Here is Fibonacci demo program written in Haskell and Squanchy. You can see code example in the [example](example.md) or the [tutorials](tutorials/index.md).

```haskell

fib x
  | x < 2 = 1
  | otherwise = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)


fib 1 = 1
fib 2 = 2
fib x = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)

```
Squanchy:

```
fib (1) -> 1
fib (2) -> 2
fib(x) -> fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)
```


## Guide
__If you want to program in Squanchy now, see the [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) for how to get started.__
Yes, there are no tutorials by the way

### Getting Started

Force us to let you download it. Then ...

```
python3 parser.py --in
```

This is only an example


## Current State
The features that are currently implemented are as follows:

* Primitive data types `List`,`String`, `Int` and `Double`
* Operators (`+`,`-`, `*`,`/`,`**`, `%`, `:`, `=`, `>`, `<=`, `and`,`or`, etc.)
* Flow control (if/the/else, while loop)
* Constants
* Tuples
* Functions
* Lambda

The following features are coming soon:

* Single and multi line comments
* Flow control (if, for)
* Data structs
* String operations
* Dictionaries
* ...
