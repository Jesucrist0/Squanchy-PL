# Squanchy Programming Language
**_Bastard son of Python and Haskell, and failed Scratch_**

## About
Squanchy is a brand new, easy to learn, general purpose, multi-paradigm, high performance programming language created by:

* **Marcos V. Conde**  [Jesucrist0](https://github.com/Jesucrist0)
* **Gabriel Rodríguez Canal**  [gabrielrodcanal](https://github.com/gabrielrodcanal)

Work on the language began on September, 2018.
The language is written from scratch (it includes an integrated lexer, parser and interpreter, etc.).

#### This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details
#### Built With

* [Python3.0](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

## Getting Started

Here is Fibonacci demo program written in Haskell and Squanchy. You can see code example in the [example](example.md).

```haskell

fib x
  | x < 2 = 1
  | otherwise = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)


fib 1 = 1
fib 2 = 2
fib x = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)

```
Squanchy:

```
fib (x) -> y ::
  if x<2 then y:1 else y: fib(x-1)+fib(x-2)
  
  
fib (1) -> 1
fib (2) -> 2
fib(x) -> fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)

```

__If you want to program in Squanchy now, see the [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) for how to get started.__



## Current State
The features that are currently implemented are as follows:

* Primitive data types `List`,`String`, `Int` and `Double`
* Operators (`+`,`-`, `*`,`/`,`**`, `%`, `:`, `=`, `>`, `<=`, `and`,`or`, etc.)
* Flow control (if/the/else, while loop)
* Constants
* Tuples
* Functions
* Lambda

The following features are coming soon:

* Single and multi line comments
* Flow control (if, for)
* Data structs
* String operations
* Dictionaries
* ...
