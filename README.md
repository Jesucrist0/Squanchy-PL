## About
Squanchy is a brand new, easy to learn, general purpose, multi-paradigm, high performance programming language created by:

* **Marcos V. Conde**  [Jesucrist0](https://github.com/Jesucrist0)
* **Gabriel RodrÃ­guez Canal**  [gabrielrodcanal](https://github.com/gabrielrodcanal)

Work on the language began on September, 2018.
